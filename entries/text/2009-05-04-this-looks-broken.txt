Body
--------------------------------
I may have built a reputation for being the guy who starts things, but never finishes. I’m okay with that. As I generalist, I try to learn as much as I can about a myriad of things. As a specialist, I get wrapped up in the details, and sometimes get lost in them. I have some goals in mind, but they tend to be a little lofty. Maybe some day the generalist, the specialist and the idealist will come together and actually finish something useful, beautiful or both.
