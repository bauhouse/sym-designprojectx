#### Then, let’s see if I can finish

The thing is, when is something really finished on the web? The web is fluid. It is constantly evolving. There’s always more to learn. So, I think “finished” will always be an elusive goal.

#### A different goal: what can I learn today?

I learn by doing. So this is me doing stuff. I’m also a perfectionist, which sometimes leads to a condition of paralysis, if I don’t want to release something into the wild if it’s not ready for public consumption. I have resolved that things will not be perfect. Mistakes are part of the process. So this is me in process. Stream of consciousness code and design.
